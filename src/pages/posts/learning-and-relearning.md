Creating this site has been a fun and frustrating process of reviving some rusty skills...

I started building this site using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), which is quite easy to set up and start using, and has a larger ecosystem with examples and reference material (it's been around longer). 11ty provides some built-in filters, like `.reverse`, so doing this on that version first was quite easy. My sense is that Astro has a slightly different philosophy, so doesn't include some of those niceties by default, and perhaps it's also a factor of being less mature.

Regardless, I decided to give Astro a try, since I'm a sucker for mucking around and learning new tools and frameworks, and I really liked how opinionated and direct it felt to get things set up. It gave me a bit of that feeling I got back in the day when I started working with [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/).
