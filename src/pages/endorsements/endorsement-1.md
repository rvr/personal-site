content: "At Travelers, I witnessed many efforts from the Enterprise Organization to introduce unified design systems and architectures. However, each line of business ran autonomously. They not only had their own design systems, but also their own, entirely separate, often incompatible technology stacks. It seemed like a problem that would take a generation to untangle. Much to my amazement, it took River less than 8 years to lead a user-centered design transformation throughout the company, and he left the companyâ€™s design systems in a much more beautiful, intuitive, and inclusive place than he found it."
